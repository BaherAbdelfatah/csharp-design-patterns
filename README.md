# C# Design Patterns
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `[C# Design Patterns]`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://linkedin.com/learning/).

There are 4 applicaitons in this repository.  Three applications are simple console application pattern examples, in the folders Iterator, Adapter, and Factory.

The 4th application, HPlusSports, is a sample of a more robust web application in ASP.Net core, to give a different example of using each of the patterns in a more realistic situation.  It is more complex than an application of similar functionality would be to show examples of architecture in a more fully featured, long term support application.
The web application is using an EF Core Backend to a SQLite Database file, to simplify running the application locally.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the .Net Core SDK 3.1 Installed
